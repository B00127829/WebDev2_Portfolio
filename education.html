    <p><img src="images/eduaction.jpg" class="wrap">Social Media and education can be used in more ways than you may think. They can be used together to help support the education of students, it can help lecturers communicate with students from their phones and computers. Social media in education can give students useful information, give them a platform to connect and communicate in groups with their peers and all in all makes education much easier for all parties.
    As the world is going with IT and social media it's important to try and keep up with the times and go with it. Most social media platforms are free and easy to use once taught well. I hope this website will have given you the information and skills that can help you set up your social media accounts and know how to use them for education.
    Social media is something that nearly every student will know how to use so it wouldn't be something that universities/ schools would need to spend time teaching.

    <h3>How Twitter can be used in teaching and learning</h3>
   
  <ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Tweet homework and assignments. 
       Both teachers and students can easily and quickly tweet details of homework and assignments using Twitter in education. You can also include links to important online sources/pages, and don’t forget to mention the due dates in your tweet. This way, everyone with an account will receive a notification, and they can share, forward or respond to the tweet.</li>
         <li>Get important educational resources. 
         Many times teachers are simply out of ideas regarding interactive and creative methods of teaching. Now, by searching for “Twitter for Teachers” resources, you can get instant access to hundreds of important links. Get insightful ideas from other teachers around the world, follow the good examples or share your own efficient teaching methods. Twitter is a good tool for professional development.</li>
           <li>Student collaboration.
           The email seems to become an old fashioned tool for collaboration. Now teachers can motivate students to use Twitter in order to work on collaborative assignments. This way, you can also intervene at any point by giving a good advice, sharing an interesting link with your students, or helping them with important resources for research.</li>
        <li>Research tool for students.
        Any student can quickly and easily find high authority research material using Twitter in education. All they need to do is type in the search bar relevant keywords, and they will receive a list with dozens of relevant websites and blogs. There is also the option to search for specific phrases, key figures, discussion topics, relevant discussion forums, etc.</li>
      <li>Create a unique classroom hashtag.
       With so many hashtags available out there, it is quite difficult to find a unique one. However, find such a relevant word and use it for your classroom hashtag. Then ask all students and teachers to join, and this will be your little virtual online classroom. Hashtags are used to find groups of interest and then connect with them, so make sure you give away your hashtag only to those you want to join the respective group.</li>
    </ol>
  </ul>
    
    <h3>How Instagram can be used in teaching and learning</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <ol> 
      <li>Finding Ideas
          A great way teachers can find new and interesting ideas to use in class would be to search around on Instagram, there are many teacher and educational accounts around that can be followed and provide great ideas. Following the hashtag #teachersofinstagram will help a teacher find those accounts easily.
       </li>
         <li>Capture Memories
          A teacher can post pictures of a lot of the memories made in class. This can be from regular days in class, to going on a trip or completing cool activities. This can remind the students of these memories and also allow their parents to see all the interesting things their children are doing at school
         </li>
         <li>Show Students Work
         Instagram is a perfect place to showcase students' works and achievements, since it works on a basis of posting pictures with a caption underneath. The class account can act as a place to post award winning projects and achievements that the students have made.
         </li>
      <li>Help Students
          Teachers can use Instagram to help students by posting homework and reminders for projects. They can also post useful tutorials or links to useful sites that the students can use to learn. The comments section can also be used to engage the whole classroom and students can learn of one another that way too. The Direct Messages can also be useful when a student needs to ask a question relating to a post privately if they don't want to comment.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </ul>
    
    <h3>How Reddit can be used in teaching and learning</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <ol>
        <li>Reddit is a site that has access to a variety of public where millions of people can share posts. Even through the maze of content, the site is still very easy to navigate, all anyone needs to do is use the search bar at the top to find what they want.
        </li>
          <li>These are some searches that are relevant to our courses this semester. As well as these two subreddits, there are hundreds of others that are beneficial for many causes. Through the subreddits people can gather up information on almost any topic within seconds. Due to the groups being public there are opinions and different works from people that come from all walks of life, giving others a wide variety of sources to collect information from.
          </li>
          <li>Reddit is not used in education as much as other social media but still has the potential to be used just as much if not more. Through the wide collection of online resources anyone can find the information they need. For a secondary school student the likes of answers for financial maths or how to properly structure an essay on Shakespere is just a click away.
          </li> 
        <li>The same for a CDM student, different photography techniques or ways to develop a characters story arc is also right there. Another benefit is that the community is there to help, if you can’t find the answer you’re looking for on the posts of the subreddit you can just ask through your own post and someone is bound to give you an answer sooner or later.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How Slack can be used in teaching and learning</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <ol>
        <li>There are many different ways for a teacher or lecturer to use social media to help teach his or her class one way they are able to use it is to post homework when they are not able to do so in class as well as informing students and their families about upcoming events. Another way it can help is if a student is not sure about something they can send them a message instead of hoping the bump into each other and ask face to face it can also be used to upload lecture videos in to group chat in facebook and twitter for people who could not come in that day.  it can also be used to monitor a students progress a prime example is the use of moodle.
        </li>
          <li>One way that Slack can be used to help in teaching is in the making of study groups when doing group assignments. This way groups do not have to meet on scheduled days but can also communicate and help each other in the comfort of their own home sending files and emails to one another and exchanging ideas and asking for their opinion and since it is almost instant you dont have to worry about about a lag in communication.
          </li>
        <li>As I said above it can also be for things other than study groups as it allow the class teacher or lecturer included to alway be able to interact with each other even outside of school allowing the student to get the most up to date information about work and events like when are grades our out straight from the staff. 
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ul>

    
    <h3>How Snapchat can be used in teaching and learning</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <ol>
       <li>There are many ways that snapchat can be used for educational purposes. Here are some examples:
        Q&A’s are very helpful with snapchat as it is not as formal as using email. It sparks a better connection between the teacher and student, therefore the student may be able to take in the information given to them easier.
        </li>
          <li>Another useful tool that snapchat has is the ability to create group chats for homework, useful links, notes, etc. What’s even better is the group call tool, this may not work as well with a large group but with a smaller group of students this could be very useful. It gives that person to person feel when you could be all be in completely different locations.
          </li>
            <li>Snapchat has this tool where stories are taken down after 24 hours which would be useful for students who have any questions or need help with something. It is up long enough for the teacher to read but also it is automatically taken down after the 24 hour period giving anonymity and privacy to the student.
            </li>
        <li>Stories are also useful for teachers to upload homework, reminders, notes and even questions for their students. Stories could be used for students to take part in quizzes or even links to useful videos or articles etc.
        </li>
       <li>Either way the possibilities are near unlimited when it comes to snapchat, it is a very fun way to educate and stay connected with your students.
       </li>
